            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2025, Tribal Tales emerged from a simple yet powerful realization: the world's most beautiful art was being created by artisans who struggled to reach beyond their local communities. These master craftspeople, often women from indigenous communities, possessed generations of knowledge and skill, but lacked the digital tools and global reach to share their work with the world.</p>
            
            <p>We started with a single weaver in Rajasthan and a dream to bridge the gap between traditional artisans and art lovers worldwide. Today, we've grown into a global platform that connects over 200 indigenous artisans with customers in 45 countries, while preserving cultural heritage and ensuring fair economic opportunities.</p>
