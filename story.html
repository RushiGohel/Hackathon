              <h3>The Encounter</h3>
              <p class="timeline-date">2019, Rajasthan, India</p>
              <p>It all began in a small village in Rajasthan where I met Lakshmi, a 65-year-old master weaver. She had been creating beautiful handwoven textiles for over 40 years, but struggled to sell them beyond her local market. Her intricate patterns told stories of her ancestors, but these stories were slowly fading away.</p>
              <div class="story-quote">
                <blockquote>"My grandmother taught me these patterns when I was just a child. Each thread carries the memory of our people. But now, the young ones don't want to learn. They say there's no money in weaving."</blockquote>

              <h3>The Realization</h3>
              <p class="timeline-date">2020, During the Pandemic</p>
              <p>As the world went into lockdown, I realized that artisans like Lakshmi were hit hardest. Their traditional markets closed, and they had no way to reach customers online. Meanwhile, people around the world were looking for authentic, meaningful art to bring beauty into their homes during difficult times.</p>

              <h3>The Mission</h3>
              <p class="timeline-date">2021, The Birth of Tribal Tales</p>
              <p>That's when I knew I had to act. Tribal Tales was born from a simple yet powerful idea: create a bridge between indigenous artisans and art lovers worldwide. We would not just sell art ‚Äì we would tell the stories behind each piece, honor the traditions, and ensure fair compensation for the creators.</p>
